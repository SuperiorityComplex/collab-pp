TODO:

- Put together engineering notebook

Deliver:
6-10 page paper, due May 7, 11:59pm ET
--> Paper describes the project, what we did, what we learned
--> Include link to code in the paper

9 minute presentation, May 1, in class


User interface commands:

Create user
- On join, user will need to create their account
- If username exists, then fail
- If username doesn't exist, then succeed and ask to join community

Join community
- Either 'none' or community name
- If community exists, then join it.
- If community doesn't exist, then create the community and join it.

Check action
- Will tell user that their action is ready, or give the number of seconds until it is ready

Check community
- Will tell user how many seconds until the next community transaction

Action
- If user's action is available, then immediately place the pixel
- If action is unavailable, respond that user must wait
- gRPC format: Color, row, column, username, community name, time=0

Delayed Action
- Like regular action, except also specify how many seconds in the future to place
- If delay is not long enough, then respond that user must wait
- gRPC format: Color, row, column, username, community name, time=time

Join Community action
- If action is available before the next community transaction happens, then join the community action
- If action is unavailable, respond that user must wait
- gRPC format: Color, row, column, username, community name, time=-1


Backend:

Must track all created users and their timers, seconds until their action is available
- Dict of users and timers
- thread which wakes up every second and decrements all users timers (requires dict lock)

Simplest way to ensure community transaction is atomic is to have single action queue
--> consume from the action queue every 0.05 seconds, make sure to lock when consuming
--> add to the action queue whenever need to, make sure to lock when adding (this can be a separate lock from the consume?)

Track users and their communities:
- or maybe community info is stored on the user side, might be easier
- Dict of communities and timers

Server threads:
- Decrement user actions
- Decrement community timers
- Queue an action / transaction
- Add to canvas by consuming from queue
